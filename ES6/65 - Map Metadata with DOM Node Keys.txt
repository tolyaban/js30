Instructor: [00:02] One of the unique properties of a map over just a regular old object, is that you can actually use an object as the key in a map. What I mean by that is, let's say we had an object right here and we wanted to use a object as the key. We can't do that. We can only use a string, where we say key, or wes, or hi, that's the only thing. 

[00:23] But what if we were able to use an object here, where the value can be a number, a string, or another object itself? That's where maps come in really handy, because they can be used as sort of a metadata dictionary, where it holds information about an object but it doesn't necessarily put that information on the object.

[00:43] Let's say I had a bunch of buttons right here, and every time I click one of those buttons I want to record how many times that specific button was clicked. 

[00:51] I could put the click count right on the element itself, but I don't really want to do that because it's kind of dirty, and if I remove the element then that count is gone with it. I could also create an object where I take something unique about this button and use that. Maybe I give them each an ID. 

[01:10] But in this case, we can actually use the button itself because when I select it it's going to be an object. We'll use that as the actual key.

[01:19] Let's make a new map called clickCounts, and then let's select every single button on the page. Now I'm going to loop over every single button and add it to this map, and we're going to set it by default zero. That's the actual click count. 

[01:35] So, button. for each button. Then for each button, we're going to add it to the map. Notice how the key is going to just be the button itself. Let's save that and we'll take a look at...Oh, it's document.query. Select all. 

[01:57] Take a look at our click counts. Look, this is our map, whereas every single key...look at that. The key is a button. I can open that up and you see that that's just a regular DOM node element right there. The key is an actual object. That's really handy.

[02:15] Now when someone clicks one of these, we'll just increment the number by one. Say, button.avidListener, then I could say val get...what is the key to get? This, right? Because I used a regular function there, this is going to be equal to the button. So get this. 

[02:38] Then we'll just console.log the val here and see what each one is. Zero, zero, obviously they're all zero right now. Then we can set it. Say click counts.set. This with the key is going to be the button, and then the value is just going to be val plus one, incremented by one. Then I'm going to console.log the click counts entire map, just to see what we're dealing with now.

[03:05] Good. So now we click snakes, open that sucker up, you see the first button which is this one, has a value of one. You could use an object or a string, or anything. I'm just using a regular old number. 

[03:16] If I click it a few more times, here we go. You can see that every time I click one of these, the click count is going on up. That's a useful case for using a map where you want to store metadata, not necessarily on the object, but you want to store metadata about an object. A map is a good use case for that.
