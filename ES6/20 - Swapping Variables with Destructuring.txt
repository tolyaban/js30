[00:02] Instructor: Let's look at a couple more examples of when you would actually use destructuring in the real world. This is not just when you want to grab variables out of an object or out of an array.

[00:13] Let's take a look right here where we're building an application for a wrestling application. In wrestling, they are tag teaming. I don't really know that much about wrestling, but I know that there's one guy in the ring and one guy on the side.

[00:27] Let's create let inRing = "The Hulkster" and we'll say let onSide = "The Rock". I'm not sure if these guys ever wrestled together, but it seems feasible. They need to tag team each other.

[00:44] What happens when you need to switch? The Rock's going in the ring and the Hulkster is going on the side. How did you do that before? If you do this, inRing is Hulk Hogan. If you say inRing = onSide, now inRing is The Rock, but then also onSide is also The Rock and we've lost the Hulkster altogether.

[01:13] How do we actually get around that? The way we used to be able to do it is we would make a temp variable. We'd say var temp = inRing, and then you'd say inRing = onSide, and onSide = temp.

[01:26] They're totally switched now, and then you would delete your actual temp variable. That's really hard to follow. That's hard to look at, especially someone coming after six months of not working on this code, trying to understand what's going on.

[01:44] With destructuring, we can just swap them. We can just take an array and say inRing, onSide = onSide, inRing. What? What that's going to do is it's going to create an array of onSide, inRing and immediately destructure them into the opposite variables.

[02:06] Now you see why I use let instead of const here, because we're actually updating the values of these variables.

[02:12] Let's take these inRing, onSide variables, console.log it beforehand, and then also console.log it right after we do it. Hulk Hogan, The Rock and then The Rock, Hulk Hogan. They've totally swapped themselves, without the need for a third swap temp variable.
