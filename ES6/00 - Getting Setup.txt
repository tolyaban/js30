[00:02] Instructor: I hope you're super excited to learn ES6. I just wanted to have a quick video, in order to get you set up for this.

[00:06] First of all, you need a browser that can support ES6. Right now, that's all of the latest versions of a browser. I'm going to be using Chrome in this one, but grab the latest Internet Explorer Edge, or Firefox, or latest Safari, and you'd be good to go.

[00:21] Once you are signed in, go ahead and you can stream the course by clicking it here. You can go ahead and download all of the videos if you prefer to watch them offline.

[00:31] Then, you also want to make sure that you grab the starter files. Now, starter files are hosted up on GitHub here. It's just a whole bunch of different HTML and JavaScript files that we're going to be using throughout the course.

[00:42] I recommend that you code all of this stuff yourself, sort of from scratch. I think it's going to set in the best. But if you prefer to just watch them and then code them after, you can do that, or if you will just need to reference some of the code, it's also available inside of here.

[00:58] There is a file called data.js. If you ever need just an array of things, or a couple objects, or just some data to actually work with, then I recommend grabbing it from here. I also use this data throughout the entire series.

[01:14] That's pretty much it, so enjoy the course. Make sure you jump into the Slack channel and chat with everyone else who's taking it. Enjoy.
